Attacker -> AttackerClient: Gain Access with Necessary Rights
note right of AttackerClient
    Attacker obtains access to an account with rights like 
    "Replicating Directory Changes" (typically Domain Admins).
end note
AttackerClient -> DC: Issue DCSync Request
note right of DC
    The attacker sends a DCSync request (IDL_DRSGetNCChanges API)
    impersonating a domain controller.
    The target DC does not verify the source, only checks rights.
end note
DC -> DC: Validate Request
note right of DC
    DC checks if the requesting SID has appropriate privileges,
    not the legitimacy of the request's source.
end note

    If privileges are sufficient, DC sends the requested data,
    including user credentials, to the attacker's machine.
end note

    Attacker uses obtained credentials to access resources or
    perform actions within the domain.
